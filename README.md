# School
this is a basic c program to try Makefile and project organizing on c/cpp

# How to build?
on terminal: make all (this compiles all the source code and links on an executable file named "program"

to run: simply type ./program on base folder

to debug: make debug (if you want to change something on source code and you get error you can open "program" in gdb debug mode)

after you done with the process you can simply type make clear to clear unnecessary files.
